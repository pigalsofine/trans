1
00:00:21,102 --> 00:00:21,748
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:23,988
In this section, we are going to learn

3
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:27,546
the types of organizational structure
and spatial features.

4
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:29,517
Let's first look at how many

5
00:00:29,955 --> 00:00:31,727
types of organizational structures there
are.

6
00:00:32,628 --> 00:00:38,720
According to the practice of most
organizations,

7
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:39,825
we find that

8
00:00:40,228 --> 00:00:42,397
there are usually

9
00:00:43,327 --> 00:00:45,644
five types of organizational structures.

10
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,934
They are: functional organizational
structure

11
00:00:48,684 --> 00:00:49,768
product organizational structure,

12
00:00:50,459 --> 00:00:51,434
geographic organizational structure,

13
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:52,983
customer organizational structure and

14
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:54,349
matrix organizational structure.

15
00:00:54,675 --> 00:00:59,303
The last one is the combination of any
two or three of these four.

16
00:00:59,712 --> 00:01:01,460
Let's look at more details about them.

17
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:03,946
First of all,  the functional
organizational structure.

18
00:01:04,216 --> 00:01:06,405
This type of structure

19
00:01:06,456 --> 00:01:08,589
groups individuals by specific functions
performed.

20
00:01:08,788 --> 00:01:10,465
In companies which use it,

21
00:01:11,007 --> 00:01:12,743
each department has different functions,

22
00:01:13,297 --> 00:01:14,971
and all similar functions of the company

23
00:01:15,368 --> 00:01:17,149
are grouped in one department.

24
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:19,540
For example, an industrial corporation

25
00:01:19,908 --> 00:01:21,105
can be divided into

26
00:01:21,985 --> 00:01:23,197
manufacturing department,

27
00:01:23,694 --> 00:01:25,991
the marketing department, the finance
department

28
00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:27,597
the R&D department

29
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:29,377
the human resources department, etc.

30
00:01:30,245 --> 00:01:32,183
The division of labour is clear-cut,

31
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:33,617
each one being charged with specific
responsibilities.

32
00:01:34,008 --> 00:01:35,327
In this figure,

33
00:01:35,327 --> 00:01:36,088
we can see that

34
00:01:36,337 --> 00:01:37,940
in the headquarters of the company,

35
00:01:38,038 --> 00:01:39,617
departments are classfied according to

36
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:42,068
different functions.

37
00:01:42,106 --> 00:01:43,837
For example function A, function B

38
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,237
Function C,Function D and so on.

39
00:01:46,743 --> 00:01:48,888
So, this is the introduction of the
functional department.

40
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:52,616
Secondly, product organizational
structure.

41
00:01:52,962 --> 00:01:56,293
Companies that follow this

42
00:01:56,545 --> 00:01:57,745
organizes products by category.

43
00:01:58,216 --> 00:01:59,137
For example, the automobile industry.

44
00:01:59,555 --> 00:02:01,312
In an automobile company,

45
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,349
cars,

46
00:02:04,865 --> 00:02:06,551
trucks, buses

47
00:02:06,856 --> 00:02:08,894
and agricultural machinery can be
produced by different departments.

48
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:11,531
But such kind of division can lead to

49
00:02:12,494 --> 00:02:16,420
a relatively loose management

50
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:17,522
in the company.

51
00:02:17,626 --> 00:02:18,645
In such case,

52
00:02:19,128 --> 00:02:20,328
Although there are some managers

53
00:02:20,397 --> 00:02:23,131
in the headquarters responsible for

54
00:02:24,237 --> 00:02:27,484
the whole system of management,

55
00:02:28,257 --> 00:02:29,762
each product group

56
00:02:30,162 --> 00:02:33,188
will have an executive or

57
00:02:33,602 --> 00:02:34,640
some managers.

58
00:02:34,853 --> 00:02:36,871
That is to say, staff is reasonably
arranged.

59
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,613
Product organizational structure

60
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,152
is usually adopted by companies

61
00:02:41,448 --> 00:02:43,567
that produce a wide range of products or
by some

62
00:02:43,902 --> 00:02:46,035
diversified companies

63
00:02:46,352 --> 00:02:48,293
whose products are greatly different.

64
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,002
We can find in the figure that at the
top of the hierarchy,

65
00:02:50,278 --> 00:02:51,845
it is still the headquarters.

66
00:02:51,991 --> 00:02:53,422
And below are

67
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:57,514
product groups according to product
types.

68
00:02:57,807 --> 00:02:59,902
Thirdly, geographic organizational
structure.

69
00:03:00,334 --> 00:03:02,032
Its name suggests that

70
00:03:02,251 --> 00:03:04,124
departments are divided

71
00:03:04,577 --> 00:03:05,780
according to regions.

72
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,000
That is to say, some departments are
located close to the needed facilities,

73
00:03:08,628 --> 00:03:10,568
while some are

74
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,321
close to customers.

75
00:03:14,266 --> 00:03:17,528
Such companies are divided into
departments

76
00:03:17,807 --> 00:03:19,594
according to regions and

77
00:03:19,982 --> 00:03:22,148
have nothing to do with functional
products.

78
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:24,011
All activities

79
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,542
in certain regions

80
00:03:26,954 --> 00:03:28,308
are managed by

81
00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:30,894
the company's branch in that area.

82
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,617
So, that is the introduction of
geographic organizational structure.

83
00:03:33,774 --> 00:03:35,285
Below the headquarters,

84
00:03:35,475 --> 00:03:36,894
there are

85
00:03:37,247 --> 00:03:39,096
region A, region B and region C, etc.

86
00:03:39,374 --> 00:03:40,628
all divided by the geographical factors.

87
00:03:41,155 --> 00:03:43,057
How many main operating areas there are,

88
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,871
how many divisions will be set.

89
00:03:45,188 --> 00:03:46,397
So, that's the point I want to stress.

90
00:03:46,788 --> 00:03:48,782
Fourthly, customer organizational
structure.

91
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:52,293
Certain industries

92
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:53,380
will organize by customer type.

93
00:03:54,432 --> 00:03:56,791
According to this principle,

94
00:03:57,007 --> 00:03:58,414
Each division serves for

95
00:03:59,054 --> 00:04:01,822
one customer group and

96
00:04:02,906 --> 00:04:05,093
does not need to consider the location
of customers.

97
00:04:06,192 --> 00:04:09,466
This is done in an effort to ensure
specific customer expectations are met
by a customized service approach.

98
00:04:10,097 --> 00:04:11,730
For example, commercial banks.

99
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,214
Most of them

100
00:04:13,496 --> 00:04:14,945
have personal credit,

101
00:04:15,677 --> 00:04:16,749
corporate credit

102
00:04:17,075 --> 00:04:19,685
housing mortgage and trust departments.

103
00:04:19,925 --> 00:04:23,108
These are obviously divided by

104
00:04:23,484 --> 00:04:25,315
customers' different needs.

105
00:04:26,394 --> 00:04:29,368
The last one is matrix organizational
structure.

106
00:04:29,674 --> 00:04:31,368
This structure is a mix of

107
00:04:31,368 --> 00:04:33,143
two or more

108
00:04:33,143 --> 00:04:35,143
organizational structures

109
00:04:35,365 --> 00:04:36,408
we just mentioned.

110
00:04:36,687 --> 00:04:38,429
These four structures

111
00:04:38,429 --> 00:04:39,472
have certain advantages

112
00:04:39,715 --> 00:04:40,794
as well as disadvantages,

113
00:04:41,007 --> 00:04:43,976
so some companies choose to

114
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:44,657
combine two or more of them,

115
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:46,663
in an effort to take advantage of their
respective strengths.

116
00:04:46,817 --> 00:04:48,447
For example, some companies

117
00:04:48,447 --> 00:04:50,749
adopt a functional organizational
structure under the geographic
organizational structure

118
00:04:51,072 --> 00:04:52,631
while some use a product organizational
structure structure

119
00:04:52,631 --> 00:04:53,982
under the geographic organizational
structure.

120
00:04:54,183 --> 00:04:55,419
To help you understand, I

121
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,062
will introduce you what sorts of
organizational structures banks would
use.

122
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,077
I will take four largest banks in
mainland China as the example.

123
00:05:00,317 --> 00:05:01,208
With headquarters in Beijing,

124
00:05:01,546 --> 00:05:03,496
they set up provincial branches in each
province and

125
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:05,872
prefecture branches in each region.

126
00:05:06,074 --> 00:05:08,139
Obviously, branches are divided by
areas.

127
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,371
Inside each bank, however,

128
00:05:09,588 --> 00:05:11,520
they would adopt the customer
organizational structure.

129
00:05:11,777 --> 00:05:13,602
So that is the matrix organizational
structure adopted by banks.

130
00:05:13,831 --> 00:05:16,284
Most corporations in our daily life

131
00:05:16,515 --> 00:05:18,906
adopt that structure.

132
00:05:19,022 --> 00:05:19,991
It is rare to see

133
00:05:20,035 --> 00:05:21,688
companies who only

134
00:05:21,979 --> 00:05:23,294
use one organizational structure.

135
00:05:23,644 --> 00:05:24,948
Then, we are going to

136
00:05:25,398 --> 00:05:28,737
focus on the spatial features of these
organizational structures or

137
00:05:29,487 --> 00:05:32,456
we say the spatial differences of

138
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,069
these organizational structures.

139
00:05:35,514 --> 00:05:36,924
Here we pay greater attention to three
of them,

140
00:05:37,558 --> 00:05:38,610
they are: functional organizational
structure,

141
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:41,259
product organizational structure and
geographic organizational structure.

142
00:05:41,937 --> 00:05:43,842
In the commonly used textbook "Economic
Geography",

143
00:05:43,842 --> 00:05:45,869
the editor Li Xiaojian

144
00:05:45,869 --> 00:05:49,208
uses Stroh Brewery Company as a case
study.

145
00:05:49,837 --> 00:05:52,317
Thia company was a large beer brewery

146
00:05:52,592 --> 00:05:53,863
located in Detroit,

147
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,934
Michigan, United States.

148
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,337
In the picture, the place where the star
is marked is Detroit.

149
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:01,511
It is obvious to find that this company

150
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:04,278
adopted the functional organizational
structure.

151
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,518
In a brewery, for example,

152
00:06:06,518 --> 00:06:07,697
production function requires

153
00:06:07,718 --> 00:06:09,620
production and purchasing.

154
00:06:10,091 --> 00:06:13,214
The whole production function is managed
by one vice president.

155
00:06:13,469 --> 00:06:15,496
Then, the marketing.

156
00:06:15,825 --> 00:06:18,082
Promoting beer is a

157
00:06:18,162 --> 00:06:19,442
a very important job for a beer company.

158
00:06:19,801 --> 00:06:22,746
And all marketing businesses are

159
00:06:22,785 --> 00:06:23,866
managed by marketing department.

160
00:06:24,094 --> 00:06:25,567
So a president is needed

161
00:06:25,816 --> 00:06:26,808
in the marketing department.

162
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,619
Similarly, the human resources
department

163
00:06:28,957 --> 00:06:30,145
also needs a manager to control.

164
00:06:30,358 --> 00:06:31,982
Judging from its spatial distribution,

165
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:35,321
most of Stroh Brewery 's  departments
were located in the eastern part of the
United States,

166
00:06:35,531 --> 00:06:37,688
so its spatial structure was relatively
concentrated.

167
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:38,948
The next case

168
00:06:39,448 --> 00:06:40,838
we are going to look at is

169
00:06:40,862 --> 00:06:41,727
about product organizational structure.

170
00:06:42,157 --> 00:06:44,328
I want to show you the example of

171
00:06:44,628 --> 00:06:45,949
Atlas Copco company.

172
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:48,263
It is a

173
00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:51,416
world-leading corporation

174
00:06:51,914 --> 00:06:54,874
headquartered in stockholm, Sweden.

175
00:06:55,685 --> 00:06:57,617
It has three

176
00:06:58,165 --> 00:06:59,866
major business areas

177
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:01,309
which are grouped according to product
types.

178
00:07:01,656 --> 00:07:03,567
First, industrial construction
department,

179
00:07:03,845 --> 00:07:05,460
then, vacuum technique department and

180
00:07:05,638 --> 00:07:06,642
finally technique related department

181
00:07:06,705 --> 00:07:08,133
these three departments.

182
00:07:08,414 --> 00:07:09,745
It has many plants.

183
00:07:09,928 --> 00:07:10,933
One thing special about it that

184
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:12,725
each of its product is produced by many
factories and

185
00:07:12,841 --> 00:07:14,450
these factories are located in many
countries.

186
00:07:14,637 --> 00:07:15,582
Another point is that

187
00:07:15,682 --> 00:07:17,771
the production of each product

188
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,958
is managed by factories in one country.

189
00:07:20,186 --> 00:07:22,115
For example, the industrial construction
technique

190
00:07:22,272 --> 00:07:24,776
is mainly in the charge of departments
in Sweden；

191
00:07:24,868 --> 00:07:26,894
the vacuum technique is in the charge of
departments in Belgium；

192
00:07:27,217 --> 00:07:29,620
the technique department is also

193
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,416
in the charge of factories in Sweden.

194
00:07:31,727 --> 00:07:32,637
In this way,

195
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:37,259
Atlas Copco guarantees its dominant
position in the international market.

196
00:07:37,745 --> 00:07:40,050
And its spatial structure

197
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:41,730
is quite dispersed.

198
00:07:41,813 --> 00:07:43,665
Compared with the company who uses
functional organizational structure,

199
00:07:43,665 --> 00:07:44,841
the structure of brewery company we just
mentioned

200
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,278
is much more scattered.

201
00:07:46,885 --> 00:07:48,000
This is because Atlas Copco manufactures
products in many countries,

202
00:07:48,097 --> 00:07:50,322
even including those in both sides of
the Atlantic.

203
00:07:50,814 --> 00:07:52,124
Such a kind of decentralized layout.

204
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,761
Next, let's focus on the spatial
features of

205
00:07:54,814 --> 00:07:57,327
geographic organizational structure.

206
00:07:57,721 --> 00:08:00,139
I want to show you the example of AGA
Corporation.

207
00:08:00,705 --> 00:08:02,930
It also has a lot of business areas and

208
00:08:02,957 --> 00:08:04,337
its products are quite diversified.

209
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:05,048
In the early days,

210
00:08:05,048 --> 00:08:07,321
its main business was

211
00:08:07,555 --> 00:08:08,678
glass production.

212
00:08:08,933 --> 00:08:11,514
This company is a quite typical one who
adopts

213
00:08:11,534 --> 00:08:12,272
the geographic organizational structure.

214
00:08:12,465 --> 00:08:14,595
To improve your understanding,

215
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:15,540
let's look at the figure 20,

216
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:18,977
those big black circles are regional
headquarters.

217
00:08:19,282 --> 00:08:21,579
That is to say, AGA sets up headquarters
in each region

218
00:08:21,777 --> 00:08:23,084
to manage

219
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,576
the production and operation activities
in this area.

220
00:08:25,718 --> 00:08:27,546
One thing interesting about the

221
00:08:27,611 --> 00:08:28,290
European headquarters and

222
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:28,968
North American headquarters

223
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:30,462
is that

224
00:08:30,562 --> 00:08:31,638
concerning AGA's four headquarters,

225
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,182
there are three headquarters in

226
00:08:33,182 --> 00:08:33,801
Europe, two of which are

227
00:08:33,842 --> 00:08:35,028
South American headquarters 1

228
00:08:35,028 --> 00:08:35,721
and South American headquarters 2.

229
00:08:36,023 --> 00:08:37,567
Why are the South American headquarters
here?

230
00:08:38,136 --> 00:08:40,088
This is because though the South
American market was relatively large

231
00:08:40,346 --> 00:08:41,712
back to the 1980s，

232
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,637
for AGA yet,

233
00:08:42,885 --> 00:08:45,362
at that time,

234
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,666
the South American market was just
entered,

235
00:08:48,874 --> 00:08:50,577
and putting headquarters in

236
00:08:50,577 --> 00:08:53,404
Europe can be safer.

237
00:08:53,594 --> 00:08:55,131
Why Europe was better?

238
00:08:55,466 --> 00:09:00,115
This was because this can help to

239
00:09:00,352 --> 00:09:03,863
communicate with the European
headquarters (the biggest one ) more
efficiently,

240
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:08,225
in an effort to promote the development
of the South American market.

241
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:10,115
So, that's the introduction of the
spatial structure

242
00:09:10,115 --> 00:09:12,708
of AGA Corporation.

243
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,992
We can therefore tell that

244
00:09:15,247 --> 00:09:18,314
AGA's spatial structure is much more
dispersed than the two companies I just
mentioned.

245
00:09:18,518 --> 00:09:19,635
Its headquarters are located on all

246
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,560
continents around the world.

247
00:09:20,841 --> 00:09:22,921
So this is all about the

248
00:09:23,176 --> 00:09:24,571
analysis we did regarding

249
00:09:24,657 --> 00:09:26,927
the relationship between companies'
organizational structures

250
00:09:27,155 --> 00:09:28,752
and spatial features.

251
00:09:29,117 --> 00:09:30,832
Before finishing this course, I have one
question for you to think about.

252
00:09:31,146 --> 00:09:32,865
The case studies we just talked are all
foreign companies

253
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:33,925
and quite old.

254
00:09:34,047 --> 00:09:35,517
So, I want you to think more about
Chinese firms.

255
00:09:35,768 --> 00:09:37,511
What are the organizational structure

256
00:09:37,588 --> 00:09:39,102
and spatial features of Chinese
companies?

257
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,700
For example, can you

258
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:43,395
analyze Shanghai Electric or

259
00:09:43,472 --> 00:09:45,677
Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industries these
corporations in Shanghai?

260
00:09:45,893 --> 00:09:47,905
What are their organizational structures

261
00:09:47,991 --> 00:09:49,635
and spatial features

262
00:09:49,902 --> 00:09:50,782
look like?

263
00:09:50,951 --> 00:09:52,515
What about corporations in other cities
of China?

264
00:09:52,515 --> 00:09:53,117
For example, Huawei in Dongguan,
Guangzhou.

265
00:09:53,608 --> 00:09:55,496
What are the innovations of

266
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,822
Huawei's organizational structure and

267
00:09:59,917 --> 00:10:03,798
its global spatial features?

268
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:06,601
That's all for today.

269
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:07,715
Thank you.
