00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,112
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:22,462 --> 00:00:23,694
Previously, we have learned

3
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,155
some basic laws of enterprise spatial expansion.

4
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:29,626
Following these laws,

5
00:00:29,626 --> 00:00:30,616
when enterprises  expand,

6
00:00:31,028 --> 00:00:34,062
what their specific modes are?

7
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,906
Regarding this issue,

8
00:00:36,906 --> 00:00:38,447
economic geographers conducted a series of studies and

9
00:00:38,728 --> 00:00:41,792
summarized two kinds of patterns.

10
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,124
One is the domestic spatial evolution mode of enterprises;

11
00:00:46,391 --> 00:00:47,991
the other is

12
00:00:48,174 --> 00:00:51,114
international spatial evolution mode of enterprises.

13
00:00:51,365 --> 00:00:55,573
So, first, let's discuss the

14
00:00:55,845 --> 00:00:58,764
domestic spatial evolution mode of enterprises.

15
00:00:59,354 --> 00:01:01,472
In this section,

16
00:01:01,591 --> 00:01:04,808
I am going to introduce you two representative models of it.

17
00:01:05,122 --> 00:01:08,634
The first one is Watts' market area expansion model.

18
00:01:09,031 --> 00:01:13,170
It was proposed by Watts in 1980,

19
00:01:13,419 --> 00:01:16,882
which is based on research on the British brewing industry.

20
00:01:17,229 --> 00:01:20,551
It explains the expansion processes

21
00:01:20,856 --> 00:01:22,915
of many small companies

22
00:01:23,081 --> 00:01:25,191
due to merger.

23
00:01:26,056 --> 00:01:29,931
He assumed that in the studied area,

24
00:01:30,296 --> 00:01:32,634
cities and towns are evenly distributed.

25
00:01:33,351 --> 00:01:35,602
And each town has one company.

26
00:01:36,705 --> 00:01:39,022
The company has only one production facility

27
00:01:39,226 --> 00:01:40,500
or one factory.

28
00:01:40,897 --> 00:01:42,740
These factories produce the same products.

29
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,038
That indicates the homogeneity of the product and

30
00:01:44,275 --> 00:01:47,226
there is no difference in product quality.

31
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:50,367
Factories sell products in their own market areas.

32
00:01:50,696 --> 00:01:52,225
That is to say, selling goods nearby.

33
00:01:52,874 --> 00:01:54,957
But due to

34
00:01:54,957 --> 00:01:56,560
the different scale of urban population,

35
00:01:57,143 --> 00:01:58,678
people in

36
00:01:58,888 --> 00:02:00,672
different cities and towns

37
00:02:01,247 --> 00:02:02,675
vary greatly.

38
00:02:03,066 --> 00:02:05,362
So, here comes to the next issue.

39
00:02:05,745 --> 00:02:08,720
Enterprises have different market demands

40
00:02:08,945 --> 00:02:11,428
and their production scales are different.

41
00:02:11,869 --> 00:02:13,736
Such difference in production scale

42
00:02:14,014 --> 00:02:16,497
can lead to the differences in production costs.

43
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,321
That means economies of scale are at work.

44
00:02:19,967 --> 00:02:21,167
Larger factories

45
00:02:21,167 --> 00:02:22,207
have relatively low production cost,

46
00:02:22,823 --> 00:02:25,182
so they have an initial competitive advantage

47
00:02:25,611 --> 00:02:28,245
and are more likely to grow faster.

48
00:02:28,779 --> 00:02:30,684
For the expansion model of market area,

49
00:02:31,268 --> 00:02:32,429
to help you understand the assumptions,

50
00:02:32,429 --> 00:02:35,668
I am going to explain the diagram on the screen to you.

51
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,748
On this figure, we can see that

52
00:02:38,026 --> 00:02:39,028
market area expansion model

53
00:02:39,051 --> 00:02:41,179
is separated into t1 t2 t3 t4

54
00:02:42,183 --> 00:02:43,445
four stages.

55
00:02:43,774 --> 00:02:45,623
For the first stage,

56
00:02:45,671 --> 00:02:46,811
stage t1,

57
00:02:46,962 --> 00:02:49,866
we see that there are 25 companies in the researched area.

58
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:52,121
I want you to pay attention to the 25 companies,

59
00:02:52,142 --> 00:02:54,118
which is the number in this picture.

60
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:56,800
From pictures t1 to t4,

61
00:02:57,108 --> 00:02:59,413
we can notice that there is a black dot in the lower left corner of each one.

62
00:02:59,457 --> 00:03:01,525
The big black dots have nothing to do
with the number of companies,

63
00:03:01,911 --> 00:03:04,094
but the size of them.

64
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,539
In stage t1,

65
00:03:06,557 --> 00:03:09,840
there are 25 companies.

66
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:12,589
What I want to remind you is that 1 7 3
in the diagram

67
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,321
don't mean 1 company,

68
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:16,557
3 companies or 7 companies,

69
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:19,090
but the size of them.

70
00:03:19,262 --> 00:03:20,388
What else can them refer to ?

71
00:03:20,562 --> 00:03:21,754
Well, they also refer to

72
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:24,687
the population size of towns served by
enterprises.

73
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,293
So, this is the first point I want you
to pay attention.

74
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:27,964
After a period of development,

75
00:03:27,964 --> 00:03:29,425
in stage t4,

76
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,798
we can see that only 3 companies left.

77
00:03:32,325 --> 00:03:33,605
In this stage,

78
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,088
the dot in the bottom left corner is 60.

79
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:37,475
What does 60 mean?

80
00:03:37,499 --> 00:03:39,241
Well, it indicates the size of this
company.

81
00:03:39,407 --> 00:03:40,000
In other words, this company

82
00:03:40,195 --> 00:03:43,496
merged with some other companies，

83
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:46,536
and 60 refers to

84
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,549
the scale after merging.

85
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:48,328
So, that's explanation of 60.

86
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,271
And other numbers represent the same
thing.

87
00:03:51,677 --> 00:03:55,303
The only difference is that there are
only 3 companies left in stage t4.

88
00:03:56,788 --> 00:03:57,558
In the diagram,

89
00:03:57,558 --> 00:03:59,348
the black dot here represents companies.

90
00:04:00,325 --> 00:04:01,671
I guess you may wonder

91
00:04:01,884 --> 00:04:03,484
why there are 4 black dots.

92
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,823
This is because in the t4 stage,

93
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:10,299
the black dot at the top left

94
00:04:10,521 --> 00:04:13,440
is a branch factory

95
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,002
or a sub-factory

96
00:04:16,254 --> 00:04:18,358
of the company whose size is 60.

97
00:04:18,868 --> 00:04:21,517
This place has a large market,

98
00:04:22,085 --> 00:04:22,927
so factories tend to be

99
00:04:23,265 --> 00:04:24,850
located here.

100
00:04:25,007 --> 00:04:26,761
But these two belong to one single
company.

101
00:04:27,395 --> 00:04:28,488
Such kind of meaning.

102
00:04:29,428 --> 00:04:30,648
Correspondingly,

103
00:04:30,648 --> 00:04:35,659
the market area of ​​those companies

104
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,699
who have survived and expanded has also
been expanded,

105
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:40,909
covering the market area of ​​many small
companies

106
00:04:41,188 --> 00:04:45,146
And it ’s the hexagon we talked about in
previous lectures.

107
00:04:46,204 --> 00:04:47,045
So, finally,

108
00:04:47,081 --> 00:04:50,420
after four stages' mergers,

109
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,914
such kind of market area is formed.

110
00:04:54,322 --> 00:04:56,026
Next, we are going to focus on

111
00:04:56,228 --> 00:04:58,225
the applicability of this model.

112
00:04:58,826 --> 00:05:03,087
It illustrates that companies with
initial cost advantages

113
00:05:03,454 --> 00:05:06,518
continuously expand outward in the
market area by

114
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:09,262
merging many neighboring small
businesses.

115
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,700
It is true in most cases.

116
00:05:12,237 --> 00:05:13,985
But there are some uncertainties we need
to pay attention.

117
00:05:14,462 --> 00:05:15,250
The first is that

118
00:05:15,502 --> 00:05:17,291
it is developed on the assumption of
economies of scale.

119
00:05:17,582 --> 00:05:19,045
Or we say economies of scale here is the

120
00:05:19,045 --> 00:05:20,145
momentum

121
00:05:20,891 --> 00:05:21,834
or the driving force.

122
00:05:22,681 --> 00:05:25,120
But, in some sectors where economies of
scale are not prominent,

123
00:05:25,354 --> 00:05:26,103
it may not that applicable .

124
00:05:26,536 --> 00:05:28,497
While, in the beverage industry

125
00:05:28,497 --> 00:05:30,497
or the brewing industry we just
mentioned,

126
00:05:31,057 --> 00:05:33,765
its economies of scale in production are
outstanding,

127
00:05:34,106 --> 00:05:35,691
its sales are targeting at the public

128
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:38,361
and the quality of the products

129
00:05:38,414 --> 00:05:39,611
is not much different,

130
00:05:39,688 --> 00:05:42,737
so this industry's sales volume is
closely related to its scale

131
00:05:42,974 --> 00:05:46,841
and the sales volume is closely related
to the price.

132
00:05:46,841 --> 00:05:48,841
That is to say, consumers demand of this
industry have

133
00:05:49,013 --> 00:05:50,640
price sensitivity,

134
00:05:50,663 --> 00:05:51,496
or the price elasticity,

135
00:05:51,973 --> 00:05:54,340
which further strengthens the economies
of scale.

136
00:05:55,401 --> 00:05:57,685
For companies that

137
00:05:57,902 --> 00:06:00,127
produce some parts of the products,

138
00:06:00,405 --> 00:06:02,077
their spatial expansion

139
00:06:02,657 --> 00:06:03,715
may not like this.

140
00:06:04,257 --> 00:06:05,520
Another point you need to focus on is
that

141
00:06:05,703 --> 00:06:07,202
it is assumed that

142
00:06:07,202 --> 00:06:10,702
the market area expands in an ideal way.

143
00:06:11,463 --> 00:06:13,994
But in reality,

144
00:06:14,349 --> 00:06:16,213
there may be a discontinuous market
expansion

145
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:17,828
due to some conditions.

146
00:06:18,198 --> 00:06:19,487
Or we say the market area expansion

147
00:06:19,487 --> 00:06:20,527
we talk about here

148
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:24,263
is a very typical contagious diffusion.

149
00:06:24,808 --> 00:06:28,734
In fact, this model does not consider

150
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,362
the hierarchy diffusion

151
00:06:31,404 --> 00:06:32,702
or channel diffusion

152
00:06:32,897 --> 00:06:34,314
or transportation and diffusion

153
00:06:34,577 --> 00:06:36,645
these forms of diffusion.

154
00:06:36,882 --> 00:06:39,105
Next, the second model we are going to
introduce in

155
00:06:39,437 --> 00:06:41,493
the domestic spatial evolution mode of
enterprises is

156
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:43,795
Taylor's enterprises metamorphosis model
and

157
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,314
the spatial evolution model.

158
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:49,294
This model was

159
00:06:49,294 --> 00:06:51,620
proposed by Taylor in 1975.

160
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,035
It also aims to

161
00:06:54,322 --> 00:06:57,517
explain a company's spatial expansion
process within a country.

162
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:00,228
But different from Watts',

163
00:07:00,551 --> 00:07:02,091
his regional evolution model

164
00:07:02,361 --> 00:07:04,948
was based on the British ironmaking
industry.

165
00:07:05,202 --> 00:07:09,048
If we say Watts focused on light
industry,

166
00:07:09,294 --> 00:07:10,660
Taylor's research object

167
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,410
was a heavy industry.

168
00:07:13,185 --> 00:07:16,459
Taylor also analyzed the mechanism of

169
00:07:16,482 --> 00:07:18,053
the evolution process in detail.

170
00:07:18,364 --> 00:07:19,931
Now, let's look at

171
00:07:21,004 --> 00:07:23,505
some key concepts in

172
00:07:23,505 --> 00:07:24,930
Taylor's enterprises metamorphosis model
and

173
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,251
regional evolution model.

174
00:07:26,574 --> 00:07:28,651
He distinguished four spatial scales.

175
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,521
The first one is the local, the smallest
scale.

176
00:07:30,927 --> 00:07:32,080
the second one, the regional,

177
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:33,517
the third one, the national,

178
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:35,028
the fourth one,  the multinational.

179
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:36,779
So,  there are four spatial scales.

180
00:07:37,114 --> 00:07:38,897
Next point, three thresholds.

181
00:07:39,271 --> 00:07:40,441
What three thresholds?

182
00:07:40,734 --> 00:07:44,080
The company has to

183
00:07:44,121 --> 00:07:47,114
cross three thresholds

184
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,371
when expanding from the local to the
multinational.

185
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,511
In this figure,

186
00:07:51,543 --> 00:07:53,780
three thresholds are clearly marked
here.

187
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,602
These three thresholds

188
00:07:55,825 --> 00:07:57,682
are closely related to the three spaces

189
00:07:58,005 --> 00:07:59,072
we are going to talk about.

190
00:07:59,614 --> 00:08:01,428
Each time a threshold is crossed,

191
00:08:01,866 --> 00:08:04,500
a metamorphosis of the enterprise is
caused.

192
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,933
In crossing the threshold,

193
00:08:07,614 --> 00:08:09,197
the company's activity space

194
00:08:09,576 --> 00:08:12,154
which is also called physical contact
space

195
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:14,693
is a specific scope of business.

196
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,909
It is the fastest.

197
00:08:17,395 --> 00:08:18,874
Then, the information space.

198
00:08:19,534 --> 00:08:21,280
Finally,  the decision space.

199
00:08:21,528 --> 00:08:23,374
The last space crosses

200
00:08:23,531 --> 00:08:24,761
relatively slow.

201
00:08:25,777 --> 00:08:27,582
So that is the introduction of the
metamorphosis model.

202
00:08:27,973 --> 00:08:29,128
Taylor's model

203
00:08:29,128 --> 00:08:31,128
integrates such a spatial scale

204
00:08:31,336 --> 00:08:35,268
thresholds and metamorphosis.

205
00:08:36,071 --> 00:08:37,285
Next, let's look at the

206
00:08:37,285 --> 00:08:38,936
evolution mechanism of enterprise
metamorphosis.

207
00:08:39,241 --> 00:08:41,294
Concerning such mechanism,

208
00:08:41,294 --> 00:08:45,167
we first discuss from the establishment
of the enterprise.

209
00:08:45,685 --> 00:08:48,565
Location is very important for the
establishment of new enterprises.

210
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,767
Many studies show that hometowns

211
00:08:51,635 --> 00:08:52,699
are the places

212
00:08:53,647 --> 00:08:56,598
where the entreprises

213
00:08:56,835 --> 00:09:00,634
tend to locate their factories at the
beginning of businesses.

214
00:09:00,817 --> 00:09:03,280
Why people choose to start a business in
their hometowns?

215
00:09:03,697 --> 00:09:06,139
Mainly because people have grwon here
and

216
00:09:06,562 --> 00:09:08,767
they have some social contact or they
are familiar with such places.

217
00:09:09,457 --> 00:09:10,482
So thinking about it in this way,

218
00:09:10,702 --> 00:09:13,768
we can see that hometown is an activity
space.

219
00:09:14,068 --> 00:09:17,700
People control a lot of

220
00:09:17,931 --> 00:09:19,238
information space over this space.

221
00:09:20,044 --> 00:09:21,416
After the company is established,

222
00:09:21,754 --> 00:09:23,315
the company's activity space,

223
00:09:23,457 --> 00:09:25,908
 information space and decision space
are limited to the local.

224
00:09:26,228 --> 00:09:27,250
In the process of the expansion of

225
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,374
the information space and decision space

226
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,725
by the activity space,

227
00:09:30,942 --> 00:09:33,223
we can think about why such kind of
expansion occurs?

228
00:09:33,303 --> 00:09:34,485
At the beginning, for example

229
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,730
the business is relatively small,

230
00:09:35,801 --> 00:09:36,948
once the company satisfys the local
market,

231
00:09:36,968 --> 00:09:38,263
and operates well,

232
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:39,736
have customers outside the local,

233
00:09:39,783 --> 00:09:41,241
by this time,

234
00:09:41,591 --> 00:09:44,002
the physical activity space can be
expanded.

235
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,017
As the physical activity space expands,

236
00:09:46,017 --> 00:09:48,779
you have to understand the information
outside the local,

237
00:09:48,844 --> 00:09:51,760
the market demand outside of local.

238
00:09:52,077 --> 00:09:54,841
At this time, on such basis, companies
make decisions

239
00:09:55,072 --> 00:09:56,817
to produce, sell and

240
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:57,671
transport.

241
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,115
So then the physical space

242
00:10:00,444 --> 00:10:03,534
information space and decision space
begin to cross.

243
00:10:04,213 --> 00:10:08,189
While, at this time, the entreprise
metamorphosis

244
00:10:08,234 --> 00:10:09,330
is caused.

245
00:10:09,757 --> 00:10:11,757
So, metamorphosis becomes the

246
00:10:12,053 --> 00:10:14,554
thresholds and obstacles in the
development of business organization.

247
00:10:15,383 --> 00:10:17,925
Here we also need to look at

248
00:10:18,171 --> 00:10:20,740
enterprises' spatial expansion

249
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:22,477
in the context of risk and uncertainty.

250
00:10:22,565 --> 00:10:24,471
Why we keep emphasizing the improtance
of

251
00:10:24,471 --> 00:10:25,641
information space and decision space?

252
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:27,840
Because they are related to the issues
of risks.

253
00:10:28,121 --> 00:10:30,838
To be more specific, sales agencies

254
00:10:31,185 --> 00:10:32,394
have the lowest risks and

255
00:10:32,634 --> 00:10:33,748
do not require additional investment.

256
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:35,505
But setting up a sales department

257
00:10:35,952 --> 00:10:37,641
or building a warehouse in a place

258
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,010
can occupy a lot of space and

259
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,200
the land rent can be high.

260
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:42,847
Specialized management is also needed.

261
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,832
All of these require much capital
investment.

262
00:10:44,832 --> 00:10:46,011
So it's more risky.

263
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,860
Perhaps you may ask why not just build a
factory over there?

264
00:10:50,281 --> 00:10:53,176
Well, I want to say factory costs much
more.

265
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,957
Land, production lines,

266
00:10:55,268 --> 00:10:58,053
equipment, employees, and production

267
00:10:58,311 --> 00:11:00,160
all need quite a large amount of
investment.

268
00:11:00,432 --> 00:11:01,733
Once the investment fails,

269
00:11:01,866 --> 00:11:03,857
entreprises will be hit hard.

270
00:11:04,201 --> 00:11:07,448
Taylor also developed a

271
00:11:07,703 --> 00:11:09,466
idealized entreprise spatial expansion
model

272
00:11:09,611 --> 00:11:11,395
In this model,

273
00:11:11,591 --> 00:11:13,697
it is assumed that a country is divided
into four regions.

274
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:15,351
Let's look at the upper right corner of
this picture，

275
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:17,611
the 3 big black dots in the three
regions

276
00:11:17,798 --> 00:11:20,980
show that there are three big industrial
agglomeration centres.

277
00:11:21,031 --> 00:11:22,942
And three little white circles

278
00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:26,112
refer to three smaller secondary urban
centers.

279
00:11:26,322 --> 00:11:27,520
Under such a regional pattern,

280
00:11:27,537 --> 00:11:29,632
let's see how a local company

281
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:31,851
expands into a national one?

282
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,112
If entreprises want to cross to other
regions,

283
00:11:34,391 --> 00:11:35,525
they should cross the first threshold.

284
00:11:35,748 --> 00:11:37,185
Then, how?

285
00:11:37,422 --> 00:11:39,442
Well, a sales office can be set up

286
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,320
in the adjacent area.

287
00:11:42,613 --> 00:11:44,082
Or to reduce the risk to the minimal,

288
00:11:44,248 --> 00:11:46,933
a sales agency

289
00:11:47,739 --> 00:11:48,568
or an agent

290
00:11:49,288 --> 00:11:50,127
can be formed here.

291
00:11:50,717 --> 00:11:53,146
Enterprises can also form a sales
office, helping

292
00:11:53,869 --> 00:11:55,395
sells products in another region.

293
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,053
That's the way how to cross the space.

294
00:11:58,545 --> 00:12:00,281
So, to summarize, we can say that
enterprises can

295
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:03,351
experience metamorphosis by

296
00:12:03,351 --> 00:12:04,142
such kind of way of spatial expansion.

297
00:12:04,394 --> 00:12:08,251
From a regional or local factory, or

298
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,546
an entreprise with only one department

299
00:12:11,727 --> 00:12:14,616
to a multi-functional, multi-location

300
00:12:14,785 --> 00:12:17,182
multi-factory and multi-sector

301
00:12:17,229 --> 00:12:19,090
national one.

302
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,248
Following this principle,

303
00:12:20,284 --> 00:12:21,484
you guys can analyze the spatial
expansion more.

304
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:24,948
Enterprises can even become a
multinational one.

305
00:12:25,309 --> 00:12:27,176
Surely, operating in different countries

306
00:12:27,188 --> 00:12:29,108
can be more challengeable and more risky

307
00:12:29,108 --> 00:12:30,562
compared with just doing businesses at
home.

308
00:12:30,776 --> 00:12:32,074
That is to say, the thresholds

309
00:12:32,302 --> 00:12:34,237
or information spaces

310
00:12:34,574 --> 00:12:38,136
and decision spaces can be stronger.

311
00:12:39,487 --> 00:12:41,576
So that is the explanation of

312
00:12:41,591 --> 00:12:44,302
Taylor's enterprise metamorphosis and
spatial evolution model.

313
00:12:44,684 --> 00:12:49,042
It is easy for you to understand through
such a diagram.

314
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,259
Before finishing this lecture, I have a
question for you to think about.

315
00:12:51,623 --> 00:12:52,660
Try to compare the similarities and
differences

316
00:12:52,992 --> 00:12:55,007
between the Watts' model and

317
00:12:55,324 --> 00:12:57,650
Taylor's model and

318
00:12:57,917 --> 00:12:59,792
and these models'

319
00:13:00,201 --> 00:13:01,946
practical application.

320
00:13:02,305 --> 00:13:03,294
Can we

321
00:13:03,543 --> 00:13:06,213
find a typical business case in China

322
00:13:06,533 --> 00:13:09,585
to see how it was developed?

323
00:13:09,703 --> 00:13:11,973
So, that's all for

324
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:15,911
the study of domestic space expansion
model.

325
00:13:16,085 --> 00:13:16,859
This is the end of this section.

326
00:13:16,974 --> 00:13:17,472
Thank you.
