00:00:21,137 --> 00:00:21,760
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,213
In this section, we are going to learn

3
00:00:24,213 --> 00:00:27,265
the international spatial evolution mode
of enterprises.

4
00:00:27,831 --> 00:00:29,419
Today' s lecture focuses on

5
00:00:29,442 --> 00:00:32,915
two representative models.

6
00:00:33,185 --> 00:00:36,648
The first one is Hakansson's global
expansion model.

7
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,312
So, let's get started.

8
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,042
The first idea we need to understand is

9
00:00:43,354 --> 00:00:45,291
the spatial structure of the
enterprise's expansion.

10
00:00:45,582 --> 00:00:46,933
In this model,

11
00:00:47,188 --> 00:00:48,142
we can see that

12
00:00:48,456 --> 00:00:52,139
Hakansson divided the space of
enterprise's expansion

13
00:00:52,687 --> 00:00:54,038
into several parts.

14
00:00:54,266 --> 00:00:55,205
In Figure 16,

15
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,200
the innermost represents

16
00:00:57,478 --> 00:00:59,487
the first centre of the enterprise.

17
00:00:59,632 --> 00:01:01,395
The circle outside the center

18
00:01:01,647 --> 00:01:03,997
is a national market area,

19
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,282
or the national market.

20
00:01:05,614 --> 00:01:07,422
It is the expanded area from the centre
and

21
00:01:07,422 --> 00:01:10,278
where large enterprises tend to locate.

22
00:01:10,616 --> 00:01:12,586
Or it is the area where big companies
are formed.

23
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:14,912
To be more specific,

24
00:01:15,164 --> 00:01:16,868
it is the area where an enterprise

25
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:19,013
can expand from a local one to a
national one.

26
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:22,080
Looking further, it is the outermost
circle.

27
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:23,863
This circle means

28
00:01:24,088 --> 00:01:26,435
markets in other countries or districts.

29
00:01:27,108 --> 00:01:29,469
Hakansson divided such market into four
parts.

30
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,512
Each part refers to different foreign
market.

31
00:01:32,794 --> 00:01:34,394
Now, I want you guys to pay attention to

32
00:01:34,734 --> 00:01:37,552
the dotted part.

33
00:01:37,647 --> 00:01:38,275
What does that

34
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,171
foreign market mean?

35
00:01:40,548 --> 00:01:44,251
Well, it refers to the market with low
proximity.

36
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:48,776
That is to say,

37
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,414
transporting goods from the central
place or the domestic market

38
00:01:50,414 --> 00:01:52,728
to this place can cost relatively a lot.

39
00:01:53,635 --> 00:01:54,711
This is the first possibility.

40
00:01:54,995 --> 00:01:56,734
The second possibility is cultural
differences,

41
00:01:57,712 --> 00:02:00,865
the recognition of the target market is
low, and it's hard to enter.

42
00:02:01,715 --> 00:02:03,620
The third one is tariff barriers

43
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,351
or the trade restrictions

44
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,360
are too high or too much,

45
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:10,456
which make it harder to enter such
market.

46
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:13,057
So, that's the features of this market.

47
00:02:14,071 --> 00:02:15,786
Next, let's explore how entreprises

48
00:02:16,162 --> 00:02:18,551
expand in

49
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:19,481
such place.

50
00:02:19,644 --> 00:02:21,437
Hakansson divided such an expansion

51
00:02:21,437 --> 00:02:22,527
into four stages.

52
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,380
For the momentum of expansion ,

53
00:02:25,638 --> 00:02:27,783
he followed a core concept,

54
00:02:28,062 --> 00:02:29,389
the market access.

55
00:02:29,611 --> 00:02:30,927
The expansion of the market is

56
00:02:31,448 --> 00:02:34,717
the primary driving force for the
spatial expansion of enterprises.

57
00:02:34,865 --> 00:02:36,272
The first stage is the

58
00:02:36,669 --> 00:02:38,118
the time when enterprises are
established.

59
00:02:38,278 --> 00:02:40,571
Companies rely on the local environment
a lot.

60
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:42,000
New companies are often

61
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,789
located in the place where founders live
or work,

62
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:46,998
just like what we said, the hometown or

63
00:02:47,345 --> 00:02:49,105
some agglomeration places,

64
00:02:49,362 --> 00:02:50,598
industrial clusters and so on.

65
00:02:51,057 --> 00:02:53,834
Before production and operation,

66
00:02:54,038 --> 00:02:55,878
the location has been decided.

67
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:57,318
In figure 17,

68
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:58,539
we can see that

69
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:01,075
there is a black dot in the innermost
circle.

70
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:03,448
That is the original location of the
factory.

71
00:03:03,546 --> 00:03:07,072
Early expansion is usually the outcome

72
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,657
of increased production capacity due to
increased demand.

73
00:03:09,013 --> 00:03:11,182
Expansion is often achieved by capital
increase.

74
00:03:11,736 --> 00:03:14,426
When the capital increase is restricted
by the site,

75
00:03:15,081 --> 00:03:16,542
or some other limitations,

76
00:03:16,773 --> 00:03:18,097
the location will be changed.

77
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,791
How?

78
00:03:21,146 --> 00:03:23,217
Relocating or building a branch.

79
00:03:24,056 --> 00:03:25,528
Then, the spatial expansion

80
00:03:25,546 --> 00:03:27,128
might occur.

81
00:03:28,471 --> 00:03:30,145
Looking at the figure, we can see that

82
00:03:30,856 --> 00:03:32,791
enterprises mianly expand in the central
place or

83
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,930
around the original location.

84
00:03:35,365 --> 00:03:36,637
In the second stage,

85
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:38,755
If the local market

86
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:40,311
can't grow as fast as what

87
00:03:40,586 --> 00:03:43,605
the enterprises expect for,

88
00:03:43,804 --> 00:03:45,718
the marketing activities will soon be

89
00:03:46,044 --> 00:03:48,118
expanded to the domestic market outside
the region.

90
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,662
So company marketing activities

91
00:03:49,905 --> 00:03:52,320
can soon be launched in other places.

92
00:03:52,651 --> 00:03:56,405
While increased business scale and
differentiation of business objectives
can

93
00:03:56,962 --> 00:04:00,343
make the company transform from one
plant to multiple plants.

94
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:02,154
The sales channels and

95
00:04:02,257 --> 00:04:04,619
the design of the wholesale network

96
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:06,414
can also be affected by many factors.

97
00:04:06,743 --> 00:04:08,248
Relevant sales organizations

98
00:04:08,631 --> 00:04:11,709
will choose to locate as much as close
to the

99
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,105
consumers and clients.

100
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,146
So we can see in the second stage,

101
00:04:15,197 --> 00:04:17,345
to sell in the domestic market,

102
00:04:17,404 --> 00:04:19,306
enterprises either to set up sales
offices or

103
00:04:19,854 --> 00:04:20,779
to build factories.

104
00:04:20,817 --> 00:04:22,165
Even if they don’t build factories,

105
00:04:22,373 --> 00:04:23,534
they would at least set up sales
organizations

106
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,653
to build a national sales network.

107
00:04:25,739 --> 00:04:28,580
And the original factory is responsible
for

108
00:04:28,788 --> 00:04:30,770
supplying goods.

109
00:04:31,469 --> 00:04:32,871
The third stage,

110
00:04:33,238 --> 00:04:35,662
as the market expands further and

111
00:04:35,928 --> 00:04:38,482
the company almost dominates the
national market,

112
00:04:39,057 --> 00:04:40,865
the sales volumes rise rapidly.

113
00:04:41,048 --> 00:04:42,542
And the enterprise will expand so fast
that

114
00:04:42,542 --> 00:04:43,840
forming a national big one.

115
00:04:44,074 --> 00:04:46,592
When they have the ability to expand
further,

116
00:04:47,466 --> 00:04:49,754
they would consider

117
00:04:49,754 --> 00:04:51,075
foreign markets.

118
00:04:51,765 --> 00:04:53,994
So we say in Economic Geography,

119
00:04:54,242 --> 00:04:56,340
we regard enterprise's export ability

120
00:04:56,364 --> 00:04:58,020
export volumes

121
00:04:58,216 --> 00:04:59,582
and net exports as a significant
competitive factor

122
00:04:59,582 --> 00:05:00,352
of the enterprise.

123
00:05:00,811 --> 00:05:04,008
Then, how companies expand overseas
market?

124
00:05:04,776 --> 00:05:06,829
Well, Hakansson's explanation can answer
it.

125
00:05:07,191 --> 00:05:11,555
Companies will first seek to promote its
products abroad,

126
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:14,826
usually in those with good exports.

127
00:05:15,054 --> 00:05:16,322
And then establish some sales agents

128
00:05:16,429 --> 00:05:18,183
or choose some overseas agents.

129
00:05:18,426 --> 00:05:20,752
So the agents in this picture is
represented with

130
00:05:20,906 --> 00:05:22,634
herringbone symbol.

131
00:05:22,705 --> 00:05:24,468
It has the lowest risk.

132
00:05:24,518 --> 00:05:25,662
If companies choose to establish sales
agents

133
00:05:25,712 --> 00:05:26,894
in those countries,

134
00:05:26,986 --> 00:05:27,934
the risk can be higher.

135
00:05:28,059 --> 00:05:30,414
Surely, this is under the condition when
the market is very optimistic.

136
00:05:31,028 --> 00:05:32,897
In other words, sales agents think the
market is very good

137
00:05:33,078 --> 00:05:33,804
and has great potential.

138
00:05:34,308 --> 00:05:36,127
The company would then establish its own
sales department in these countries,

139
00:05:36,183 --> 00:05:38,675
or to purchase a previous agent

140
00:05:38,962 --> 00:05:40,080
and upgrade it into a sales department.

141
00:05:40,198 --> 00:05:41,682
This is the second pattern.

142
00:05:42,237 --> 00:05:43,422
Through this pattern,

143
00:05:43,437 --> 00:05:45,608
enterprises can open the targeted
country's market quickly.

144
00:05:45,917 --> 00:05:46,957
The fourth stage,

145
00:05:47,108 --> 00:05:49,220
the overseas market expands very fast.

146
00:05:49,546 --> 00:05:53,226
If enterprises still produce
domestically,

147
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:55,626
and supply foreign markets by export,

148
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,997
the transportation volume can be very
huge.

149
00:05:58,242 --> 00:06:00,023
Huge transportation volume can lead to

150
00:06:00,328 --> 00:06:02,168
high transportation cost.

151
00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:04,607
Since the costs go up, the product
prices will be increased too.

152
00:06:04,687 --> 00:06:05,641
And finally, the products may not that
competitive.

153
00:06:05,762 --> 00:06:07,505
By this time, there are two choices for
enterprises.

154
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,789
First, producing in the native market,

155
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,078
Second, export.

156
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,961
If the cost of the first one is

157
00:06:14,005 --> 00:06:15,745
higher than the latter one,

158
00:06:16,115 --> 00:06:18,462
the rational choice for the enterprises
is to

159
00:06:18,684 --> 00:06:21,463
build a factory in the local market.

160
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:23,120
In such case,

161
00:06:23,496 --> 00:06:28,026
the enterprise is no longer a national
one,

162
00:06:28,284 --> 00:06:30,897
but a multinational company

163
00:06:31,028 --> 00:06:33,493
which builds factories

164
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,882
in multiple countries.

165
00:06:34,897 --> 00:06:36,293
Such a kind of multi-location company.

166
00:06:36,503 --> 00:06:37,834
Looking back at the figure,

167
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,826
in the dotted circle

168
00:06:38,826 --> 00:06:40,826
we just mentioned represents the

169
00:06:40,995 --> 00:06:43,149
market which is hard to enter.

170
00:06:43,534 --> 00:06:45,931
So by this time, as the

171
00:06:46,183 --> 00:06:47,703
company operation improves and

172
00:06:48,225 --> 00:06:49,031
scale expands,

173
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,429
some sales agents can be set up or

174
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:55,386
some factories can be built here.

175
00:06:55,751 --> 00:06:57,327
That means investing overseas

176
00:06:57,451 --> 00:06:58,794
and building factories over there allow
enterprises

177
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:00,560
to become a local enterprise.

178
00:07:00,832 --> 00:07:02,213
Then they can supply nearby

179
00:07:02,453 --> 00:07:06,097
and avoid trade barriers.

180
00:07:07,108 --> 00:07:08,882
So that is the basic ideas of
Hakansson's

181
00:07:08,882 --> 00:07:12,862
global expansion model.

182
00:07:13,262 --> 00:07:15,777
Then, another point,

183
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,831
what is the expansion momentum?

184
00:07:18,731 --> 00:07:20,204
Well, two words can summarize it.

185
00:07:20,376 --> 00:07:21,540
that is,

186
00:07:23,117 --> 00:07:25,623
market occupation.

187
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,226
Surely, it is not the

188
00:07:27,226 --> 00:07:28,610
only momentum behind entreprises'
spatial expansion.

189
00:07:28,684 --> 00:07:30,595
I want to remind you that

190
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,080
in some cases,

191
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:35,531
factors such as ensuring the supply of
raw materials (close to raw materials)

192
00:07:36,317 --> 00:07:39,188
and using cheap labor

193
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,514
can make the entreprise invest in

194
00:07:41,514 --> 00:07:43,514
building the factory or merge with other
factories.

195
00:07:43,842 --> 00:07:45,911
In China,

196
00:07:46,112 --> 00:07:47,715
many enterprises or

197
00:07:47,982 --> 00:07:49,066
foreign investment enterprises

198
00:07:49,354 --> 00:07:52,545
are close to the origin of raw
materials.

199
00:07:52,903 --> 00:07:54,071
So, that's all about Hakansson's model.

200
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:55,961
So, next, I am going to introduce you

201
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,961
Dicken's global shift.

202
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,825
Dicken is a famous economic geographer

203
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:03,294
who studies globalization

204
00:08:03,324 --> 00:08:05,223
and a representative of the Manchester
School.

205
00:08:05,407 --> 00:08:07,300
Global shift is one of his classic
theories.

206
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,223
This model was

207
00:08:09,588 --> 00:08:11,982
proposed by Dicken in 1986.

208
00:08:12,228 --> 00:08:14,598
He then developed it further in 1990.

209
00:08:15,102 --> 00:08:17,001
The model aims to

210
00:08:17,268 --> 00:08:19,022
reveal entreprises' international

211
00:08:19,362 --> 00:08:20,509
expansion process.

212
00:08:20,954 --> 00:08:22,708
It demonstrates

213
00:08:23,025 --> 00:08:25,561
the ideal evolution of a manufacturing
company

214
00:08:25,902 --> 00:08:27,315
from production in its home country

215
00:08:27,315 --> 00:08:28,877
to production in multiple countries.

216
00:08:29,087 --> 00:08:31,834
Compared with previous models,

217
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:34,005
this model adds

218
00:08:34,242 --> 00:08:35,659
the rationalization of the company's
internal adjustment

219
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:37,727
and considers both

220
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,558
the investment process

221
00:08:39,801 --> 00:08:41,472
and the withdrawal of

222
00:08:41,736 --> 00:08:43,167
investment process.

223
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:46,847
That is to say, both the global
production network

224
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,885
or we say the reorganization process of
sales network

225
00:08:48,933 --> 00:08:51,451
and the domestic reorganization process

226
00:08:51,478 --> 00:08:53,339
or we say a combination of domestic and
global ones

227
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:54,322
are included.

228
00:08:54,551 --> 00:08:57,351
So the shift is a global one.

229
00:08:57,635 --> 00:08:59,395
This model is divided into five stages.

230
00:08:59,662 --> 00:09:00,817
Let's look at the first stage.

231
00:09:01,096 --> 00:09:03,152
Suppose a multi-factory company

232
00:09:03,475 --> 00:09:08,405
whose production and sales agencies are
located in country 1.

233
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,988
And we call it the home country.

234
00:09:10,669 --> 00:09:12,299
Enterprises supply overseas markets
through exports.

235
00:09:13,472 --> 00:09:14,560
In the second stage,

236
00:09:14,802 --> 00:09:16,047
enterprises begin overseas expansion.

237
00:09:17,434 --> 00:09:18,826
That is to say,

238
00:09:19,048 --> 00:09:21,048
sales agencies and

239
00:09:21,306 --> 00:09:22,885
and sales departments

240
00:09:23,691 --> 00:09:24,432
begin to be set up.

241
00:09:24,805 --> 00:09:26,074
The third stage,

242
00:09:26,281 --> 00:09:28,568
enterprises begin overseas production.

243
00:09:29,054 --> 00:09:30,346
In the diagram, we

244
00:09:30,447 --> 00:09:34,325
can see that overseas expansion

245
00:09:34,515 --> 00:09:36,234
also follows the order,

246
00:09:36,565 --> 00:09:40,441
from far to near,

247
00:09:40,598 --> 00:09:42,672
such kind of contagious diffusion rule.

248
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,551
What does overseas production mean?

249
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,272
As shown in the diagram,

250
00:09:46,521 --> 00:09:47,712
we can see that the market

251
00:09:47,952 --> 00:09:49,081
can be guaranteed.

252
00:09:49,662 --> 00:09:50,518
Why?

253
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,736
This is because after the sales agents'
market survey

254
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:55,979
or the sales department's operation,

255
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,983
the market is found to be optimistic

256
00:09:59,179 --> 00:10:00,047
or we say the sold products

257
00:10:00,047 --> 00:10:01,857
can cater for local customers.

258
00:10:02,192 --> 00:10:04,062
In such case, the overseas production

259
00:10:04,168 --> 00:10:06,450
will not be that risky.

260
00:10:06,642 --> 00:10:07,854
The fourth stage,

261
00:10:07,946 --> 00:10:09,765
international production and operation
activities further expand.

262
00:10:09,807 --> 00:10:11,060
In other words,

263
00:10:11,105 --> 00:10:12,897
products are produced

264
00:10:13,081 --> 00:10:14,960
and sold

265
00:10:15,117 --> 00:10:16,050
in more countries.

266
00:10:16,696 --> 00:10:18,456
At the last stage,

267
00:10:18,678 --> 00:10:20,385
some reasonable adjustments are
necessary.

268
00:10:20,651 --> 00:10:21,786
That is to say, it is important to

269
00:10:22,062 --> 00:10:24,287
optimize the international network

270
00:10:24,346 --> 00:10:26,521
for production and management

271
00:10:26,731 --> 00:10:27,505
both at home and abroad.

272
00:10:27,611 --> 00:10:28,927
The right part

273
00:10:28,948 --> 00:10:30,589
represents the production.

274
00:10:30,746 --> 00:10:32,177
According to Hakansson,

275
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:35,549
within the country, different
manufacturers in different countries

276
00:10:35,629 --> 00:10:38,091
only responsible for part of the
production.

277
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:41,300
And finally, before launching,

278
00:10:41,401 --> 00:10:42,568
products are assembled over factories
within another country.

279
00:10:42,616 --> 00:10:44,272
If this, in those countries,

280
00:10:44,441 --> 00:10:45,875
the international division of labor

281
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,238
is formed.

282
00:10:47,315 --> 00:10:49,807
The network of supplying products to the
global market

283
00:10:50,257 --> 00:10:51,466
is created.

284
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,256
I guess some of you may ask

285
00:10:53,555 --> 00:10:54,767
why it is like this.

286
00:10:54,877 --> 00:10:56,281
Why parts of the products are produced
in some countries but

287
00:10:56,302 --> 00:10:57,271
assembled in

288
00:10:57,564 --> 00:10:59,217
another country?

289
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,440
Well, there are many considerations.

290
00:11:02,023 --> 00:11:03,816
Companies either to make full use of
some places'

291
00:11:04,035 --> 00:11:04,714
production capacity,

292
00:11:04,951 --> 00:11:06,548
or their resources advantage,

293
00:11:06,755 --> 00:11:09,940
or the cheap labor force advantage.

294
00:11:10,551 --> 00:11:11,297
This is the first kind of consideration.

295
00:11:11,602 --> 00:11:14,296
Another consideration is very possible.

296
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,705
That is tax avoidance,

297
00:11:16,924 --> 00:11:18,056
which is considered by many
multinational enterprises around the
world.

298
00:11:19,534 --> 00:11:20,100
Since a multinational enterprise

299
00:11:20,317 --> 00:11:22,272
owns an internal production network,

300
00:11:23,197 --> 00:11:25,884
it can reduce costs by exchanging
internally.

301
00:11:27,768 --> 00:11:30,515
In this way, the loss or

302
00:11:32,088 --> 00:11:33,810
high product prices can be avoided
possibly.

303
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:35,614
That is to say,

304
00:11:35,813 --> 00:11:39,374
tariff barriers or some tax policies
limitations

305
00:11:39,863 --> 00:11:43,256
in some countries can be avoided.

306
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:44,989
To be more specific,

307
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:45,795
that is how Apple Company

308
00:11:46,924 --> 00:11:48,337
does around the world.

309
00:11:48,657 --> 00:11:50,571
Some enterprises in China also follow
this rule.

310
00:11:51,007 --> 00:11:52,038
So, before finishing this lecture,

311
00:11:52,065 --> 00:11:53,096
I have a question for you to think
about.

312
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,934
Since we have studied the four spatial
expansion models,

313
00:11:55,994 --> 00:11:58,651
try to find out the similarities and
differences of them.

314
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,040
That's all

315
00:12:01,371 --> 00:12:02,382
for today.

316
00:12:02,891 --> 00:12:03,528
Thank you.
